# Standards

## General

- File paths should *always* use backslash ("\\") - unless required by an external tool
- File paths should never end with a backslash ("\\")
- All file paths and file path processing should be done in lower case
    - Easier comparisons
    - Easier replacement

## Maxscript

- Keep maxscript syntax as similar to python wherever possible
